# notebook_express

This is a practice that building a simple CRUD app by using
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
* Pure.css

***
There are several files that I was working on:

#### server.js

Set up the configuration of express app and also the routes here.

#### models/notebook.js

Set up the data schema and pass data to controllers

#### controllers/notebook.controller.js

I put all functions that handle create, read, update, and delete data here.

#### index.ejs, new.ejs, edit.ejs

Set up the main page, and also pages for creating and updating data. 

***

There are few things that I want to do in the future
* Improve the naming of variables and functions
* Optimise front-end pages by using CSS modules
* Write a simple tutorial of building this app
